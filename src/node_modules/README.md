# /src/node_modules

## Overview

This folder contains bits of javascript that can be used on the client or server. By putting them in a folder called `node_modules`, they can be `require()`'ed from anywhere within the `/src` folder without having to specify a path. e.g. `const foo = require('foo');` instead of `const foo = require('../../../../foo');`.
